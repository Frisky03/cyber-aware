INSERT INTO `tbl_solutions` VALUES (1,'malware','Never download or install software from a source you don’t trust completely'),(2,'malware','Never open an attachment or run a program sent to you in an email from someone you don’t know. '),(3,'malware','Keep all your software up to date.'),(4,'malware','Make sure a Trojan antivirus is installed and running on your computer'),(5,'malware','Install anti-virus and anti-spyware software.Anti-virus and anti-spyware programs scan computer files to identify and remove malware. Be sure to: Keep your security tools updated.Immediately remove detected malware. Audit your files for missing data, errors, and unauthorized additions.'),(6,'malware','Use secure authentication methods. The following best practices help keep accounts safe:Require strong passwords with at least eight characters, including an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a number and a symbol in each password.Enable multi-factor authentication, such as a PIN or security questions in addition to a password.Use biometric tools like fingerprints, voiceprints, facial recognition and iris scans.Never save passwords on a computer or network. Use a secure password manager if needed.'),(7,'malware','Use administrator accounts only when absolutely necessary. Malware often has the same privileges as the active user. Non-administrator accounts are usually blocked from accessing the most sensitive parts of a computer or network system. Therefore: Avoid using administrative privileges to browse the web or check email.Log in as an administrator only to perform administrative tasks, such as to make configuration changes.Install software using administrator credentials only after you have validated that the software is legitimate and secure.Keep software updated. No software package is completely safe against malware. However, software vendors regularly provide patches and updates to close whatever new vulnerabilities show up. As a best practice, validate and install all new software patches:Regularly update your operating systems, software tools, browsers and plug-ins.Implement routine maintenance to ensure all software is current and check for signs of malware in log reports.'),(8,'malware','Control access to systems.There are multiple ways to regulate your networks to protect against data breaches: Install or implement a firewall, intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS).Never use unfamiliar remote drives or media that was used on a publicly accessible device.Close unused ports and disable unused protocols.Remove inactive user accounts.Carefully read all licensing agreements before installing software.Adhere to the least-privilege model.Adopt and enforce the principle of least-privilege: Grant users in your organization the minimum access to system capabilities, services and data they need to complete their work.'),(9,'malware','Limit application privileges. A hacker only needs an open door to infiltrate your business. Limit the number of possible entryways by restricting application privileges on your devices. Allow only the application features and functions that are absolutely necessary to get work done.'),(10,'malware','Never click on unsafe links: links, an automatic download could be started, which could lead to your computer being infected.'),(11,'malware','Avoid disclosing personal information: If you receive a call, text message, or email from an untrusted source requesting personal information, do not reply. Cybercriminals who are planning a ransomware attack might try to collect personal information in advance, which is then used to tailor phishing messages specifically to you. If in any doubt as to whether the message is legitimate, contact the sender directly.'),(12,'social','Delete any request for personal information or passwords. Nobody should be contacting you for your personal information via email unsolicitedly. If you get asked for it, it’s a scam.'),(13,'social','Reject requests for help or offers of help. Social engineers can and will either request your help with information or offer to help you (i.e posing as tech support). If you did not request any assistance from the sender, consider any requests or offers a scam. Do your own research about the sender before committing to sending them anything.'),(14,'social','Set your spam filters to high. Your email software has spam filters. Check your settings, and set them to high to avoid risky messages flooding into your inbox. Just remember to check them periodically as it is possible legitimate messages could be trapped there from time to time.'),(15,'social','Secure your devices. Install, maintain and update regularly your anti-virus software, firewalls, and email filters. Set your automatic updates on if you can, and only access secured websites. Consider VPN. '),(16,'social','Always be mindful of risks. Double check, triple check any request you get for the correct information. Look out for cybersecurity news to take swift actions if you are affected by a recent breach. I recommend subscribing to a couple of morning newsletter to keep you up to date with the latest in InfoSec like Cyware or BetterCloud Monitor. If you are a podcast person, Decrypted by Bloomberg, DIY Cyber Guy and Reply All offer easy to digest information and news that’s very user-friendly.'),(17,'software','Know your vendors. Ensure that your organization is aware of each service provider who contributes to your extended supply chain. Due to the massive scale of cyber ecosystems and newly added shadow IT, decision-makers may discover business relationships that they were not previously aware of. Full visibility of vendors enables improved tracking and security management.'),(18,'software','Conduct a risk assessment. Formal processes -from security questionnaires to on site visits- can help your organization obtain a complete understanding of how seriously your vendors and suppliers adhere to supply chain security best practices. While these initiatives can be time consuming, they can yield significant payoffs in the long-run.'),(19,'software','Implement least privileged access. Organizations commonly provide undue, excessive access and permissions to employees, partners and other third-parties. As a result, supply chain attacks are easier to execute than they should be. By implementing least privileged, and assigning all persons and software necessary permissions only, your organization will mitigate risk.'),(20,'software','Network segmentation. Short of true need, third-parties should not be able to access every point within your network. This is unnecessary. Implement network segmentation to divide the network into zones based on business functions. When organized this way, it’s more of a challenge than it would otherwise be for hackers to compromise your business operations.'),(21,'software','Follow DevSecOps practices. Integrate security into your development lifecycle; this makes it easier to detect whether or not software has been modified in malicious ways.'),(22,'software','Automated threat prevention and threat hunting. Security operations centers (SOC) analysts can protect organizations from attack by improving endpoint, network, cloud and mobile security.'),(23,'software','Address the fourth party problem. Supply chain risks do not begin and end with third-parties. Your vendors likely have a long list of subcontractors and vendors of their own. Mitigating fourth-party risk remains difficult, although some cyber security tools can provide monitoring and tracking options for fourth-party groups.'),(24,'software','Security awareness. October is Cyber Security Awareness month, and you’ve likely just run a series of exercises within your organization to help employees understand phishing, smishing and ransomware threats, at the least. Security awareness initiatives should take place year-round, including friendly information about any new, common threats to watch out for.'),(25,'software','Assume that the possibility of a data breach remains. Develop your incident response plan, read expert insights surrounding supply chain security, and check out our piece titled The Short Guide to Why Security Programs Can Fail.'),(26,'apt','Install a Firewall. Choosing a firewall is an essential first layer of defense against APT attacks. Software firewalls, hardware firewalls, and cloud firewalls are the 3 most common types of firewalls used – any of which will help you prevent advanced persistent threats.'),(27,'apt','Enable a Web Application Firewall. A web application firewall is a useful tool for defeating APT attacks because it can detect and prevent attacks coming from web applications by inspecting HTTP traffic.'),(28,'apt','Install an Antivirus. Up-to-date antivirus programs can detect and prevent a wide range of malware, trojans, and viruses, which APT hackers will use to exploit your system.Make sure that your antivirus can access real-time data and detect the newest threats, instead of only being able to recognize well-known malware.'),(29,'apt','Implement Intrusion Prevention Systems. Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are an essential IT security service that monitors your network for any strange behavior or malicious code and alerts you if any is found.This is a powerful tool for recognizing network compromises before they can be exploited.'),(30,'apt','Create a Sandboxing Environment. A sandbox is a secure, virtual environment that allows you to open and run untrusted programs or codes without risking harm to your operating system.If a file is found to be infected, you isolate it, remove it, and prevent future infections.'),(31,'apt','Install a VPN Remote access risks such as an insecure WiFi hotspot, present an easy opportunity for APT hackers to gain initial access to your company’s network.A virtual private network (VPN) provides an encrypted “tunnel” that you and your employees can use to access your network without cybercriminals snooping on your activity or gathering your data.  '),(32,'apt','Enable Email Protection Email is one of the most-used and most-effective forms of infiltration. Advanced persistent threat protection relies on good software as much as it does on good end-user behavior.Enable spam and malware protection for your email applications, and educate your employees on how to identify potentially malicious emails.'),(33,'ddos','Know your network’s traffic. Every organization’s infrastructure has typical Internet traffic patterns — know yours. When you understand your organization’s normal traffic pattern, you’ll have a baseline. That way, when unusual activity occurs, you can identify the symptoms of a DDoS attack.'),(34,'ddos','Create a Denial of Service Response Plan. Do you know what will happen when and if a DDoS attack happens? How will your organization respond? By defining a plan in advance, you’ll be able to respond quickly and efficiently when your network is targeted. This can take some planning; the more complex your infrastructure, the more detailed your DDoS response plan will be. Regardless of your company’s size, however, your plan should include the following: A systems checklist, A trained response team, Well-defined notification and escalation procedures, A list of internal and external contacts that should be informed about the attack, A communication plan for all other stakeholders, like customers, or vendors'),(35,'ddos','Make your network resilient. Your infrastructure should be as resilient as possible against DDoS attacks. That means more than firewalls because some DDoS attacks target firewalls. Instead consider making sure you’re not keeping all your eggs in the same basket — put data centers on different networks, make sure that not all your data centers are in the same physical location, put servers in different data centers, and be sure that there aren’t places where traffic bottlenecks in your network.'),(36,'ddos','Practice good cyber hygiene. It goes without saying that your users should be engaging in best security practices, including changing passwords, secure authentication practices, knowing to avoid phishing attacks, and so on. The less user error your organization demonstrates, the safer you’ll be, even if there’s an attack.'),(37,'ddos','Scale up your bandwidth. If DDoS is creating a traffic jam in your network, one way to make that traffic jam less severe is to widen the highway. By adding more bandwidth, your organization will be able to absorb more to absorb a larger volume of traffic. This solution won’t stop all DDoS attacks, however. The size of volumetric DDoS attacks is increasing; in 2018, for example, a DDoS attack topped 1 Tbps in size for the first time. That was a record… until a few days later, when a 1.7 Tbps attack occurred.'),(38,'ddos','Take advantage of anti-DDoS hardware and software. DDoS attacks have been around for a while and some kinds of attacks are very common. There are plenty of products that are prepared to repel or mitigate certain protocol and application attacks, for example. Take advantage of those tools.'),(39,'ddos','Move to the cloud. While this won’t eliminate DDoS attacks, moving to the cloud can mitigate attacks. The cloud has more bandwidth than on-premise resources, for example, and the nature of the cloud means many servers are not located in the same place.'),(40,'ddos','Know the symptoms of an attack.Your network slows down inexplicably. The website shuts down. All of a sudden, you’re getting a lot of spam. These can all be signs of a DDoS attack. If so, the organization should investigate.'),(41,'ddos','Outsource your DDoS protection. Some companies offer DDoS-as-a-Service. Some of these companies specialize in scaling resources to respond to an attack, others bolster defenses, and still, others mitigate the damage of an ongoing attack.'),(42,'ddos','Monitor for unusual activity. Once you know your typical activity and the signs of an attack, monitor your network for odd traffic. By monitoring traffic in real-time, your organization will be able to spot a DDoS attack when it starts and mitigate it.'),(43,'mitm','Secure connections. A secure internet connection is your first line of defense. To that end, only visit websites with a secure HTTP connection using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology. The additional SSL protection prevents MITM attacks.'),(44,'mitm','VPN. One of the best practices for network security is to use a VPN (virtual private network) when connecting online. A VPN encrypts the data you send online.'),(45,'mitm','Endpoint security. Despite your best efforts, you or your staff can fall prey to MITM attacks. These attacks combine with malware to gain unrestricted access to your device or IT network.'),(46,'mitm','Multi-factor authentication. If you’re tricked by a MITM attack and the criminal gains your login credentials through a fake website, all is not lost if you use multi-factor authentication (MFA).'),(47,'mitm','Education. Businesses are particularly vulnerable to MITM and other cyberattacks. Organizations are attractive targets for criminals, and unsuspecting employees can unwittingly open doors for these villains.'),(48,'password','Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)'),(49,'password','Enforce and Manage Strong Passwords'),(50,'password','Use different passwords for all your accounts.'),(51,'password','Use a password manager'),(52,'malware','Do not open suspicious email attachments: Ransomware can also find its way to your device through email attachments. Avoid opening any dubious-looking attachments. To make sure the email is trustworthy, pay close attention to the sender and check that the address is correct. Never open attachments that prompt you to run macros to view them. If the attachment is infected, opening it will run a malicious macro that gives malware control of your computer.'),(53,'malware','Never use unknown USB sticks: Never connect USB sticks or other storage media to your computer if you do not know where they came from. Cybercriminals may have infected the storage medium and placed it in a public place to entice somebody into using it.'),(54,'malware','Keep your programs and operating system up to date: Regularly updating programs and operating systems helps to protect you from malware. When performing updates, make sure you benefit from the latest security patches. This makes it harder for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities in your programs.'),(55,'malware','Use only known download sources: To minimize the risk of downloading ransomware, never download software or media files from unknown sites. Rely on verified and trustworthy sites for downloads. Websites of this kind can be recognized by the trust seals. Make sure that the browser address bar of the page you are visiting uses \"https\" instead of \"http\". A shield or lock symbol in the address bar can also indicate that the page is secure. Also exercise caution when downloading anything to your mobile device. You can trust the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store, depending on your device.'),(56,'malware','Use VPN services on public Wi-Fi networks: Conscientious use of public Wi-Fi networks is a sensible protective measure against ransomware. When using a public Wi-Fi network, your computer is more vulnerable to attacks. To stay protected, avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions or use a secure VPN service.'),(57,'malware','Backup regularly. Since Wiper Malware destroy data it would be advised to regularly backup your data especially the important ones.'),(58,'malware','Monitor for changes. This is for determining whether there is something wrong with your device.'),(59,'malware','If infected with worm, Isolate the device. Worms can spread through LANs, so disconnect your infected device from the internet and remove it from your LAN.'),(60,'malware','Assess the spread. Scan your other devices using antivirus software to see if the worm has already spread. If it has, isolate all the other infected devices and perform steps three and four.'),(61,'malware','Remove the worm. Most antivirus tools that detect computer worms can also remove them. Once they find a worm, most antivirus software can quarantine or remove the malware automatically.'),(62,'malware','If needed, use a specialized worm-removal tool. Some worms are more stubborn. If your antivirus software can’t remove it, search the internet for a worm-removal tool specific to the type of worm on your device. Your antivirus’s scan log should offer a clue as to what type of worm it is.'),(63,'malware','Conduct spam and content filtering for inbound email for spyware countermeasures'),(64,'malware','Use the appropriate security software.'),(65,'malware','Keep mobile apps and OSes up to date.'),(66,'malware','Limit your file-sharing. This can at least diminish your chances of getting infected by malware.'),(67,'malware','Never allow unsanitized, unvalidated user inputs or inputs from untrusted sources.'),(68,'malware','Use parameterized queries to prevent SQLi attacks.'),(69,'malware','Secure coding practices and application development'),(70,'malware','Leverage CDN so that users do not have direct access to the server.'),(71,'malware','Install SSL and follow the latest SSL security best practices');
